This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
source("http://thegrantlab.org/misc/cdc.R")
```

```{r}
View(cdc)
```

```{r}
tail(cdc$weight,20)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(height, weight))+
  geom_point()+
  xlab("Height (inches)")+
  ylab("Weight (pounds)")
```

```{r}
cor(cdc$weight,cdc$height)
```

```{r}
height_m <- cdc$height * 0.0254
weight_kg <- cdc$weight * 0.454
```

```{r}
bmi <- (weight_kg)/(height_m^2)
plot(cdc$height, bmi)
```

```{r}
cor(cdc$height,bmi)
```

```{r}
sum(bmi >= 30)
```

```{r}
plot(cdc[1:100,"weight"],cdc[1:100,"height"])
```

```{r}
sum(bmi>=30)
```

```{r}
obese <- cdc[bmi>=30,]
length(obese[,1])
male_obese <- sum(obese$gender == "m")
male_obese
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
